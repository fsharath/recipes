Tandoor/Tandoori in Hindi or Urdu means charcoal oven which basically is a clay cylindrical structure
on the inside lined with morot on the outside to insulate heat. In simple terms they are like small sized
kilns with a small opening on the top. Though Indian food is all about sauces, rice and bread tandoor style 
cooking is a xital part of Indian Cuisine as some parts of India still rely on firewood and charcoal for 
their cooking purposes.

These dishes have meat ot paneer (indian cottage cheese) as base marinated with some kind of sauce overinight.
You can use a charcoal grill with lid on for best results. Else gas grill or ovens (least recomended unless 
you have broil). All you need is some wodden skewers soaked in water or metal skewers and you are good to go.
