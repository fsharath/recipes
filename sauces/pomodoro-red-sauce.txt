Rachael's Epic Pomodoro Sauce
-----------------------------
10 tbsp olive oil
2 cans San Marzano tomatoes, crushed
5-10 cloves of garlic, sliced
2-3 handfuls fresh basil
2 tsp red pepper flakes
a good amount of salt (to taste)

Add oil to pan alongside garlic and red pepper flakes.  Turn heat to medium-high and saute until garlic browns (it'll look like little garlic chips).  Add the tomatoes and salt and stir slowly.  Let the mixture simmer for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  The oil from the first step will pool on the top of your sauce at the outset, but, scout's honor, it will permeate into your sauce given time.

When the oil on top of the sauce has reduced, taste it; the raw tomato flavor should have cooked off by this point.  Tear in the basil then let it wilt down and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Like magic, if you do it right, the oil should kind of all mix in, and it will magically be fucking awesome.

Yields a pot's worth of the best thing ever (and it tastes even better in leftover form)
