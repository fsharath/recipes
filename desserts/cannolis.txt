Dr. Conte's Cannolis
--------------------
Filling:
3 cups ricotta cheese
1-1/4 cups sugar
2 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 cup finely chopped candied citron
1/4 cup chocolate chips
2 well-beaten eggs
2 tbsp white vinegar
2 tbsp cold water

Combine ricotta cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract and blend 10 minutes until smooth.  Add the candied citron and chocolate chips, then switch off the mixer and stir in the eggs.

Switch the blender back on and blend in the white vinegar and cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Finally, chill the filling in the refrigerator.

Shells:
3 cups flour (all-purpose)
1/4 cup sugar
1 tsp cinammon
1/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp shortening
several egg whites
cooking oil for frying shells(of your choice)
cannoli tubes

Sift the flour, sugar, cinammon, and salt together and cut in the shortening.  Place the mixture onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it 'comes together' as a dough.  Wrap the dough in waxed paper and chill it for 30 minutes.

Heat oil to 360 degrees F, then roll the dough to 1/8" thickness.  Cut the dough into 6" by 4-1/2" ovals and wrap each around the tubes, sealing the edges with egg white.  Fry tubes for 8 minutes then remove them from the oil.  When the shells are cool enough to touch, work them off of the tubes.  When the shells are completely cooled, stuff them with the filling.

Yields 16 to 18 cannolis
