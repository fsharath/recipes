My Chocolate-Orange Balls
-------------------------
12 oz. semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup and 2 tbsp light corn syrup
1 cup frozen orange juice concentrate
5 cups vanilla wafer crumbs (use the 'chop' setting on the blender to make these crumbs)
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
powdered sugar

Melt the chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler then add the corn syrup and frozen orange juice concentrate.  The temperature differential here will resolidify the chocolate, so turn up the heat.  When the mixture returns to a molten state, remove it from the heat.

Blend the vanilla wafer crumbs together with the confectioners' sugar.  Mix this with the chocolate that you recently removed from the heat (and if you're feeling sinister, go off and add that cup of chopped pecans) then wait 30 minutes.  Roll into 1" balls and douse each in a fair bit of powdered sugar.

So as to save yourself some embarrassment (and to prevent awkward conversations), be sure to keep your chocolate-orange balls in the freezer.

Yields 45-60 balls
