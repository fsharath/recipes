Dr. Conte's Cheesecake
----------------------
Crust:
1-3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup walnuts, finely chopped
1/2 tsp cinammon
1/2 cup melted butter or margarine (margarine tends to work better)

Mix all together and press into a 10" springform pan.  Press the sides first, then empty the rest of the mixture into the bottom of pan and press down.

Filling:
3 well-beaten eggs
2 8oz packages softened cream cheese (microwave on medium 40 seconds, use Kraft brand)
1 cup sugar
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp almond extract
3 cups sour cream

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Combine everything but sour cream, and beat until smooth (note: there will still be pellet-sized pieces of cream cheese, so don't overbeat).  Stir in (don't beat) sour cream, then pour into crust.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until it appears to be just set (like Jello).  Cool in pan for ~30-40 minutes, then remove sides.  Carefully remove a modicum of the extra crust above the filling and crumble onto top.  Chill on bottom of pan for 2-4 days in refrigerator.

Serves a plethora of partygoers, great for fans of both cheese and cake
