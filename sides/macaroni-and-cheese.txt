Macaroni and Cheese Casserole
-----------------------------
1/2 lb uncooked macaroni
1 tsp butter
1 egg, beaten
1 tsp dry mustard
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp hot water
1 cup milk
3 cups grated sharp cheese (cheddar's the doctrinaire choice here)

Boil macaroni in water until tender and drain well.  Stir in the butter and the egg.

In a separate bowl, add the milk.  Mix the mustard and salt with 1 tbsp hot water and add it to the milk.  Set this mixture aside.

Add cheese to macaroni, reserving enough to sprinkle over the top.  Place macaroni in a greased casserole dish, add milk mixture, and sprinkle it with reserved cheese.  Bake your casserole in a preheated oven about 45 minutes or until the custard is set and the top is crusty.

Serves six to eight (nippish) people
