Patra Family Indian Butter Chicken
----------------------------------
2 to 3 tbsp butter
1 onion
1/4 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp crushed garlic
2 tsp crushed giner
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
1 to 2 tsp ground chili
1 tbsp coriander
14 oz. skinless, boneless chicken thighs or breasts
1/4 to 1/2 cup ground almonds
8 oz. can whole peeled tomatoes with juice
1 tbsp tomato paste
1/2 cup unsweetened yogurt

With chicken, there is always a risk of food poisoning, so it is important to
clean your hands, board, and knives before and after working with the raw
meat.  Trim and cut the chicken into small cubes, cover and put aside.  With a
clean knife and board, slice the onions into thin wedges (lyonnaise).  Heat a
large saucepan or frying pan and melt 2 to 3 tablespoons of butter until it is
frothy.  Add the onions and the cinnamon to the pan and fry lightly.  When the
onions are soft, stir in the crushed garlic and ginger, then add the turmeric,
chili, and coriander and saute over medium heat.

The spices are fried first to release their maximum flavor and this really
enhances the dish.  Add the cubed chicken and saute, stirring constantly until
the chicken has turned white.  Pour in the ground almonds, tomatoes, and
tomato paste.  Mix thoroughly.  Cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.  Add
the yogurt and heat through.

Serve on rice with a salad and Indian bread if desired.

Serves 4 to 6 rather peckish people
