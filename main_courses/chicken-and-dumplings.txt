Sussex County Slippery Chicken and Dumplings
--------------------------------------------
2-1/2 to 3 lb. chicken (whole)
4 cups chicken broth
dumplings (recipe follows)

Prepare dumplings.  Drop dumplings one by one into boiling broth.  Cook, uncovered, about 15 minutes.

Dumplings:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
4 tbsp crisco (level) or less (forming a lump about the size of a large walnut)
hot water, 7/8 cup

Mix flour, salt, and shortening with fingertips or fork until all lumps disappear and it looks like very fine cornmeal.  Add hot water gradually to make a soft dough.  Be careful when adding the water towards the end, as too much water and the dough will be too sticky.  It may look all right, but test it by kneading it a little before adding the very last of the water.

Knead dough on floured surface about 20 times.  Divide dough into two or three portions and roll each out very thinly on a floured surface.  Cut into squares.

Serves four (hungry) people
